This project was done in collaboration with two beginner level engineering students. The aim of the project was to learn more about Android application develpment, the Facebook SDK and how face recognition works using OpenCV.

Currently, the master branch uses old versions of the Facebook and Android SDK, and doesn't work due to deprecation. This branch (remake) is tracking the work of getting the project up to date with the latest versions of the SDKs.
